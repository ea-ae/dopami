# dopami

The name is a placeholder. Dopami is a full-stack web application created primarily for learning purposes.

## Deployment

TODO CI/CD + Docker. Build backend (VS2022 preferred), `npm install` & `npm run prod` to build frontend. To start the application, run a reverse proxy (e.g. `npm run server` for the dev server) together with the web server.
